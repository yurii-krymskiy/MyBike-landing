# Bike Shop Landing Page

## Project Overview
The Bike Shop Landing Page is a one-page website designed to promote and sell bikes. It features a clean and engaging design, with a header, footer, and four main sections. Users can navigate through the sections using a menu that provides easy access to various parts of the page.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** Defines the structure and content of the landing page.
- **SCSS (Sass):** Styles the landing page for a visually appealing and consistent look.
- **BEM (Block Element Modifier):** Organizes CSS classes for modularity and maintainability.
- **JavaScript:** Enhances interactivity and functionality, such as a gallery and contact form.

## Sections
The landing page is divided into the following sections:

1. **Header Section:** The header contains the website logo, a navigation menu, and a call-to-action button for visitors to explore the featured bikes.

2. **Recommended Products Section:** In this section, users can find a selection of recommended bikes for sale. Each product includes an image, name, price, and a "Buy Now" button for quick purchases.

3. **Gallery Section:** The gallery section showcases a collection of high-quality images of the available bikes. Users can scroll through the images to get a better view of the products.

4. **Information Section:** This section provides essential information about the bike shop, such as its mission, values, and commitment to quality products and customer satisfaction.

5. **Contact Form Section:** The final section allows visitors to get in touch with the shop. It includes a contact form where users can enter their details, inquiries, or feedback.
